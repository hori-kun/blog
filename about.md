*Gingerbeard*, for lack of a better name though I’m quite partial to it, is on a mission to raise mental health knowledge and awareness. I'm looking forward to releasing an eBook and a print-on-demand paperback soon.

The general business model will be having the content freely available online on the blog with a copyright protecting the content. Then an eBook and a print-on-demand book will be available which is effectively donating to the cause of providing accurate, reliable mental health information to the masses. This isn’t about money, it’s about providing an insight into what makes mental health issues tick. The entire cause will be under the label *Gingerbeard* which will be an organisation that creates a movement of raising mental health awareness. Unfortunately I believe everything I posted on my Quora blog is owned by them so this will be a complete rewrite of my story and knowledge of mental health issues for now. Hopefully for the better.

I’m excited by this opportunity and I hope people get behind the cause. Mental illness is ravaging today’s health systems and its not getting the treatment or research it deserves. Schizophrenia at least is a common disease affecting roughly one percent of the population. Take a grade of students from a school and at least one of them will probably have schizophrenia. That’s the case from my grade at least, though there could be more. If people are willing to contribute to the blog and book I would be happy to include their content. The more the merrier.

I think given the ability to write we're in a special position to really show people what it’s like to live with, or around, debilitating mental health issues. I think it’s important we get the message out there even if it does come over as a ‘wall of text.’ These writings of ours need to create a message for the general population and the professionals that we are real people with real needs, not ‘raving lunatics,’ and even then these most vulnerable people need the most love and nurturing.

Schizophrenia is a disease of the soul because of the so-called negative symptoms which include diminished expression and avolition. Avolition is the defining characteristic of schizophrenia which directly attacks what it means to be human. Be that wants, hopes, dreams, or ambitions, or simply sleeping, eating, and being hygenic, they’re all struck down by the subtle but insidious nature of schizophrenia. But what are negative symptoms exactly and what can we do to help it?

# Symptoms
Diminished expression can be split into two domains: blunted affect (reduced intensity and range of emotional expression shown in verbal or non-verbal modes of communication), and alogia (reduced quantity of speech and loss of conversation fluency). Avolition can be split into three domains: amotivation (deficits in the initiation and maintenance of goal-oriented behaviors), anhedonia (impaired anticipation of reward), and asociality (diminished interest in social interactions with others).

# Causes
The exact mechanism by which  negative symptoms come about is unknown but it’s supposed that there’s a cognitive deficit afoot. Almost certainly the prefrontal cortex (which affects judgement and planning) and the temporal lobes and limbic system (which affect memory, emotion, and rewards) are malfunctioning. One theory supposes that the noise levels in the brain rise in a schizophrenic and as a defense mechanism against this increase in noise negative symptoms come about. There’s also a theory supposing the limbic system is malfunctioning specifically in terms of reward systems resulting in avolition.

# Treatment
Unfortunately there’s no effective drug treatment for negative symptoms as the mainstay drug of choice for the schizophrenic, the antipsychotic, doesn’t treat cognitive deficits but the positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations and delusions. However, psychosocial treatment has proven efficacious in the treatment of negative symptoms. Psychosocial treatment revolves around education, psychotherapy, behavioural training, and help with employment, housing, and family relations. Psychosocial treatments offer reassurance, morale building, companionship, commonsense advice, and help with practical problems. Families can also seek therapy to avoid both confrontation and emotional distancing.
